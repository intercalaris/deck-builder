# Deck Buikder

A full-stack web app for creating pokemon decks. Supports user creation and user-specific deck creation.
To run locally, clone the repository, install dependencies using `npm install`, and start the server with `npm run dev`. Experimented with tailwind, won't be using it again lol.
Access the app at `http://localhost:8000`.
